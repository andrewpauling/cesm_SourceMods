The freshwater flux is set up in subroutine set_fwf_interior in file forcing_fwf_interior.F90
This subroutine is sent variable S_SOURCE as input. The subroutine then computes the interior freshwater flux and adds it to S_SOURCE. Thus we want our freshwater flux term to have the same units as S_SOURCE that is input. 

Subroutine  set_fwf_interior is called in baroclinic.F90 at line 1870. The salinity source in baroclinic.F90 is called WORKN(:,:,2)

Note that the index 2 is for salinity (1 = temperature) in variables that are accociated with "tracers". Temperature and salinity are tracers.

Note that at line 1897 in baroclinic.F90 WORKN is added to FT

baroclinic.F90 lines 1700 and 1701 indicate that FT and WORKN are used to compute time derivatives of the tracers
      FT,                &! sum of terms in dT/dt for the nth tracer
      WORKN               ! work array used for various dT/dt terms 

baroclinic.F90 line 1935 is 
               TNEW(:,:,1,n) = c2dtt(1)*FT(:,:,n) - etc.
which to me says the updated tracer is some delta time * FT 

This is why I think FT and WORKN and S_SOURCE should be in units of salinity divided by time. The  model salinity units are g/g (g of salt per g of water, so convert to ppt or psu by dividing by 1000)
